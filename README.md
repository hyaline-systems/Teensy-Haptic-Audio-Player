# Teensy-Haptic-Audio-Player

A PCB designed for audio and haptic projects with [a Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html). 

It allows you to play audio from the computer as a sound card when connected via USB or from audio files via the on board SD card reader.

The audio will then be output both to a 3.5mm audio jack and a haptic driver that will vibrate in sync with the audio.

The whole thing is open source and hackable and is designed to be used for many different scenarios.

## Features
